Hi! This is my first programming task in C, and I've decided to make it completely open source for the time being. Anyone can build on this!
This specific version of Go is designed to be very minimalist, and as such easy to make minor edits to for compilation via cc65 (https://cc65.github.io/) for 6502-based systems.
Please contact me on my discord account a2sys if you encounter any bugs. Tysm!
